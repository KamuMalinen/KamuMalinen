# About me

Computing and Electrical Engineering student majoring in software development.

Have interests but no real expertise in

- cybersecurity
- difficult games
- and general peripheral "[hifistely](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hifistely)"

among other things technical.

Regarding non-technical topics, I find rats (the animal) to be fascinating and
simplicity to be ideal most of the time.
